untitled gaming community website drafts


louisiana melee website draft (louisianamelee.gg available through godaddy)
 
 1st phase - provide a direct link to the discord community
 safety concern #1, the discord is a safe space for LGBTQ+ individuals and a public facing link is vulnerable to abuse and harassment. would need a non-invasive quick vetting process. possible solution in increased discord moderation.
 safety concern #2, VPN check for discord invite link
 
 
 2nd phase - provide a public facing calendar thats connected to a discord workflow for TO usage. (they can generate the event in a discord channel and it will populate the website calendar)
 
 
 
 3rd phase - Current and previous power rankings, history of melee scene, player spotlights and affiliated social media page embeds. (louisiana melee twitter for recent tournament results featuring louisiana players) 
 ((summit campaign integrations for louisiana players??)) fundraising in general, though just a breif summary as the main goal loops back around to community management through discord.
 
 
 website needs to be stylish and functional on both tradition and mobile browsers.
 
 1. top google search result for "Louisiana Smash" / "Louisiana Melee"
 
 2. implement a responsive layout, this allows the website to rescale itself depending on device viewing it.
 
 
 Use breakpoints for the most commonly used device resolutions used across mobile, desktop, and tablet. These would be:
 
 1920×1080 (9.61%)
 1366×768 (7.87%)
 360×640 (4.36%)
 414×896 (4.34%)
 1536×864 (4.11%)

 
 3. no pop up ads
